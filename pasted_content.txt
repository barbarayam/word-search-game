Role: You are an expert Frontend and Gamification Developer tasked with creating a highly interactive, competitive web application for Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Open House.Context & Goal: The app is a digital word search game called "The Business Lexicon Lock," designed to run on a large public display (projector/monitor) in the Diploma in Business Studies (DBS) room. Its primary purpose is to engage visitors (teens and adults) for 90 seconds, educate them on core DBS skills, and create a competitive atmosphere.Target Output: A single-page, responsive web application ready for deployment, ideally using a modern, lightweight stack.1. Core Technical RequirementsRequirementDetailsTechnology StackUse React or Vue.js for the frontend framework. Ensure the UI is highly responsive but optimized for landscape viewing on a large screen/touchscreen. The application must be serverless (static hosting).InteractionSingle-user interaction using a mouse, trackpad, or touch gesture to select/swipe the words directly on the grid.Styling/BrandingThe design must be modern, clean, and energetic, using a color palette similar to Ngee Ann Polytechnic's official branding (professional, reliable tones, e.g., blues/whites/greys). The NP/DBS logo should be prominently displayed.2. User Flow & FeaturesThe user flow is a single, timed session for one player.StepFeature DescriptionConstraint/SpecificsA. Start ScreenDisplays the app title ("The Business Lexicon Lock"), NP/DBS logo, the rules, and a "Start 90-Second Challenge" button.Must be intuitive. Include the high score from the database.B. Game InterfaceDisplays the Word Search Grid, the Timer, the Clue List, and the Live Score.Timer: Prominent countdown from 90 seconds. Grid Size: Recommended 10x10 or 12x12 for visibility.C. Word MechanicsWords are found by clicking/swiping the start and end letters.Success: Found words must be highlighted (e.g., in a bright NP-branded colour) and cannot be selected again.D. Clue-Based RevealThe list displayed to the user must initially contain 12 Clues, not the actual words. When a word is correctly found on the grid, the corresponding Clue is replaced by the actual Business Term (e.g., "The study of markets" changes to "MARKETING").This is the core gamification layer.E. End GameThe game ends when the timer hits zero OR all words are found.Post-Game Display: Show the final score, the time taken (if all words were found), and a "Submit Score" button.3. Content and DataThe application must be built to easily accept a JSON file input for the game content.Content ListExample/DetailsWord List (12)Must be case-insensitive: FINTECH, DATA, STRATEGY, MARKETING, ENTREPRENEUR, HUMANCAPITAL, LOGISTICS, ANALYTICS, ADAPTATION, INNOVATION, RISK, ETHICS.Clue List (12)Short, engaging clues corresponding to the words (e.g., Clue for FINTECH: "The fusion of finance and technology.").Live ScoreboardA basic local storage or simple JSON file/database mock for the Top 10 scores (Name and Time/Score).4. Constraints and DeploymentNo user registration: Player entry is limited to a single "Enter Name" text box before the game starts.Performance: Must load quickly and run smoothly on modern browsers, even on mid-range devices (to ensure reliability during the open house).Accessibility: Use high-contrast colours for the grid and clear, legible fonts.Final Instruction:Generate the complete frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Framework) for this application. Provide a simple, clear guide on how to update the word list and deploy the static files. Focus on creating a visually appealing and highly interactive user experience.
